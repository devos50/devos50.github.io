I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Distributed Systems department of [Delft University of Technology](https://tudelft.nl), focussing on building efficient and scalable decentralized systems.
My research interests include decentralized systems, distributed systems, electronic markets, and blockchain technology.

**Previously:**
In 2021, I completed my PhD thesis titled [_Decentralization and Disintermediation in Blockchain-based Marketplaces_](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:a4f750b6-5ac5-4709-80c5-71eb71ac7b35), under the supervision of Dick Epema and Johan pouwelse.

I completed my master thesis at Delft University of Technology in 2016. In my master thesis titled [_Identifying and Managing Technical Debt in Complex Distributed Systems_](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:e5a817a4-ce0a-4dd3-afd4-d70660b63d16), I improved various aspects of our long-running academic software, named [Tribler](https://tribler.org).

I also have my own company named [CodeUp](https://code-up.nl). My primary business activity is app development and web hosting. You can find more information about these activities on the website of [CodeUp](https://code-up.nl).

Besides my professional activities, I enjoy travelling, snowboarding and bouldering.
