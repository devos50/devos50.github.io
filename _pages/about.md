I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [the Scalable Computing Systems (SACS) Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/sacs/) of [EPFL University](https://epfl.ch), focussing on building efficient and scalable machine learning systems.
My research interests include machine learning systems, distributed and decentralized systems, and distributed ledger technology.

**Previously:**
In 2021, I completed my PhD thesis titled [_Decentralization and Disintermediation in Blockchain-based Marketplaces_](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:a4f750b6-5ac5-4709-80c5-71eb71ac7b35), under the supervision of Dick Epema and Johan pouwelse.

I completed my master thesis at Delft University of Technology in 2016. In my master thesis titled [_Identifying and Managing Technical Debt in Complex Distributed Systems_](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:e5a817a4-ce0a-4dd3-afd4-d70660b63d16), I improved various aspects of our long-running academic software, named [Tribler](https://tribler.org).

I also have my own company named [CodeUp](https://code-up.nl). My primary business activity is the development of mobile application (iOS/Android) and web/email hosting. You can find more information about these activities on the website of [CodeUp](https://code-up.nl).

Besides my professional activities, I enjoy travelling, snowboarding, bouldering and reverse engineering software. One of my projects involve the emulation of legacy Apple devices, which software can be found [here](https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios).

You can find my curriculum vitae [here](assets/pdf/resume.pdf).
